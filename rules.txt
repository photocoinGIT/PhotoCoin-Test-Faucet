PHOTOCOIN TERMS OF USE & SERVICE AGREEMENT
Effective Date: March 9th, 2025

This Terms of Use and Service Agreement (“Agreement”) sets forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the PhotoCoin platform (“PhotoCoin”, “Service”, or “Platform”), which is a web3 crypto project with a dedicated website, a server-side application (server.py), and an integrated smart contract. By accessing or using the Service, you (“User”) agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please refrain from using the Service.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Overview:
PhotoCoin is an innovative crypto-earning platform accessible exclusively via personal computers. The platform allows Users to register by connecting their Metamask wallet, signing a transaction with the smart contract, and subsequently sending a registration request via server.py—all through a simple button click.

1.2. Purpose:
The purpose of PhotoCoin is to enable Users to convert deposited crypto tokens into internal “Photocoin” tokens at a dynamically changing exchange rate. Users can earn Photocoins through various activities including posting photos with text captions, receiving likes, and engaging in interactions such as liking posts that subsequently receive additional likes.

1.3. Service Evolution:
PhotoCoin reserves the right to modify, suspend, or update any part of the Service at any time without prior notice. Continued use of the Service after modifications constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.

2. DEFINITIONS
For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms are defined as follows:

PhotoCoin: The crypto project offering the Service that combines a website, server application (server.py), and smart contract.
User: Any individual or entity that registers and uses the Service.
Metamask: A crypto wallet application used for connecting to the PhotoCoin platform.
Smart Contract: A blockchain-based automated contract that processes registrations, token conversions, content postings, and other transactions.
Photocoin: The internal token issued by the Service upon conversion of crypto tokens deposited by the User.
Crypto Token: Any digital token (e.g., Wbera, Monad, or any other token chosen by PhotoCoin in the future) that can be exchanged for Photocoins.
Sponsored Post: A feature that enables Users to promote their posts (via an additional fee) to gain enhanced visibility and a distinctive badge.
Transaction: Any action that involves signing and executing a smart contract operation (e.g., registration, conversion, posting, or liking).
Commission: The fee required to execute any transaction, imposed by both the underlying blockchain network and the Service.
3. DESCRIPTION OF THE SERVICE
3.1. Service Functionality:
PhotoCoin provides Users with the following features(incomplete and inaccurate list, ask us for details):

Registration: Users connect their Metamask wallet and sign a transaction with the smart contract. Following this, a request is sent to server.py for final registration.
Token Deposit and Conversion: Users may deposit crypto tokens into the smart contract, where these tokens are automatically converted into Photocoins at a dynamically determined rate.
Content Posting: Users can upload photos along with text captions. Posts can be optionally upgraded to sponsored posts (subject to a fee) to secure a special badge and higher placement in the feed.
User Interactions: Liking posts is processed through the smart contract. Users earn Photocoins both when their posts receive likes and when they like posts that subsequently receive additional likes.
Conversion Back: Photocoins can be converted back to crypto tokens (subject to a 2% commission and a dynamically changing exchange rate) only after specific conditions are met (e.g., after a predetermined period such as one month from registration or other criteria defined by PhotoCoin). This condition is communicated in a user-friendly manner to ensure clarity without discouraging participation.
3.2. Platform Limitations:
The Service is optimized for use on personal computers only. Mobile devices are not supported at this time.

4. REGISTRATION AND ACCESS
4.1. Registration Process:
To register, the User must:

Connect an active Metamask wallet.
Sign the required transaction in the smart contract to register on the blockchain.
Submit a registration request via server.py.
4.2. User Obligations:
Users agree to provide accurate, up-to-date information during registration and to update their details as necessary. PhotoCoin shall not be liable for loss of access due to misplaced private keys, passwords, or any authentication details.

4.3. Security Measures:
Users are solely responsible for maintaining the security of their digital credentials. Any unauthorized access due to the User’s failure to secure their credentials is strictly their responsibility.

5. TRANSACTIONS, OPERATIONS, AND TOKEN CONVERSIONS
5.1. Deposits and Conversions:
Upon depositing crypto tokens into the smart contract, these tokens are automatically converted into Photocoins at an exchange rate determined algorithmically and subject to market conditions and Service parameters.

5.2. Earning Photocoins:
Users earn Photocoins by:

Receiving likes on their posts (according to a predetermined formula).
Engaging with content (e.g., liking a photo that later receives additional likes), also as per a defined formula.
5.3. Conversion Back to Crypto:
Photocoins may be converted back to crypto tokens (such as Wbera, Monad, or others to be determined) only when PhotoCoin authorizes such a conversion. The conversion rate is subject to fluctuations, and a commission fee of 2% is applied.

5.4. Transaction Fees:
All operations executed through the Service require signing a transaction, which incurs a fee as dictated by the underlying blockchain network and PhotoCoin’s internal policies.

5.6. Liquidity and Withdrawal Limitations:
Users acknowledge that the availability of withdrawals from the PhotoCoin platform is subject to overall liquidity within the smart contract system.

By using the Service, users explicitly accept the risk of liquidity shortages and agree that PhotoCoin is not liable for any associated inconveniences or financial losses.

By using the Service, users explicitly agree to comply with all withdrawal conditions in place at the time of their transaction and accept any future changes that may affect their ability to withdraw funds.

Users may choose to upgrade their posts to “Sponsored Posts” by paying an additional fee. Such posts receive a distinct badge and are prioritized in the content feed for enhanced visibility.
